## 📘 Assignment Summary
This assignment covers practical firewall configuration using IPTables.  
I created multiple rules for web servers, MySQL, SSH, Telnet, ICMP, and MAC/IP filtering.  
Each rule was tested using Windows-side tools and verified using Wireshark packet captures.  
Both servers were thoroughly documented, including original and updated IPTables tables.
