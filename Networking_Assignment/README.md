## 📘 Assignment Summary
This assignment documents how I set up and verified networking across two servers.  
I configured static IPs, updated DNS settings, installed troubleshooting tools, and tested connectivity.  
Both Ubuntu and CentOS were configured using commands such as `nmcli`, `ip addr`, `ip route`, and `ping`.  
I also created and used scripts to collect network information and provide basic troubleshooting steps.
